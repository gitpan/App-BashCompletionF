NAME
    App::BashCompletionF - Backend for bash-completion-f

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of App::BashCompletionF (from Perl
    distribution App-BashCompletionF), released on 2014-10-31.

FUNCTIONS
  add_all_pc(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Search PATH for scripts that use Perinci::CmdLine and add completion for
    those.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file => *str*

        Use alternate location for the bash-completion-f file.

        By default, the "complete" scripts are put in a file either in
        "/etc/bash-completion-f" (if running as root) or
        "~/.bash-completion-f" (if running as normal user). This option sets
        another location.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

  add_entry(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Add a completion entry.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   content* => *str*

        Entry content (the actual "complete ..." bash command).

    *   file => *str*

        Use alternate location for the bash-completion-f file.

        By default, the "complete" scripts are put in a file either in
        "/etc/bash-completion-f" (if running as root) or
        "~/.bash-completion-f" (if running as normal user). This option sets
        another location.

    *   id* => *str*

        Entry ID, for marker (usually command name).

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

  add_entry_pc(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Add a completion entry (shortcut for Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI
    programs).

    This is a shortcut for "add_entry". Doing:

     % bash-completion-f add-pc foo

    will be the same as:

     % bash-completion-f add --id foo 'complete -C foo foo'

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file => *str*

        Use alternate location for the bash-completion-f file.

        By default, the "complete" scripts are put in a file either in
        "/etc/bash-completion-f" (if running as root) or
        "~/.bash-completion-f" (if running as normal user). This option sets
        another location.

    *   program* => *str*

        Program name to add.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

  clean_entries(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Delete entries for commands that are not in PATH.

    Sometimes when a program gets uninstalled, it still leaves completion
    entry. This subcommand will search all entries for commands that are no
    longer found in PATH and remove them.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file => *str*

        Use alternate location for the bash-completion-f file.
